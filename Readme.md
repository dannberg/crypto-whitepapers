# Cryptocurrency Whitepapers in Markdown

A collection of Cryptocurrency Whitepapers in Markdown format. Currently contains:

- Bitcoin Whitepaper
- Ethereum Whitepaper
- Solana Whitepaper

## Description

I wanted to add a few cryptocurrency whitepapers to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but wasn't able to find clean Markdown versions of each. So I decided for format them myself.

These can be imported directly into Markdown-based editors. Images are hosted on Imgur, so should be accessible in most View modes.

These are standard, clean Markdown files, rather than block-based Markdown files optimized for [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/). If you'd prefer block-based formatting, I've included a link to that format in this Readme where ever possible.

All credit is due to the original authors.
